/**
 * View Model for a Screen.  Used in [Experience]s.
 *
 * Rover View Models are a little atypical compared to what you may have seen elsewhere in industry:
 * unusually, layouts are data, so much layout structure and parameters are data passed through and
 * transformed by the view models.
 *
 * Implementers can take a comprehensive UI layout contained within a Rover [Screen], such as that
 * within an Experience, and lay all of the contained views out into two-dimensional space.  It does
 * so by mapping a given [Screen] to an internal graph of [RowViewModelInterface]s and
 * [BlockViewModelInterface]s, ultimately yielding the [RowViewModelInterface]s and
 * [BlockViewModelInterface]s as a sequence of [LayoutableViewModel] flat blocks in two-dimensional
 * space.
 *
 * Primarily used by [BlockAndRowLayoutManager].
